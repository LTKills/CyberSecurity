# Hack the Box

Be careful as you may get severely spoiled!


This repo does not contain `root.txt` or `user.txt` files. It does, howerver, hold useful files and scripts used to exploit hack the box machines. I recommend you not to use any of the resources posted here (1) before you try doing things on your own and (2) before you've read them carefully (don't trust my scripts, I'm not a specialist and my scripts may have several security flaws)
