# Sec
Useful files and scripts used during my security studies.


For now the purpose of this repo is not to hold a list of walthroughs or tutorials, it's just a useful way for me to share files related to the security challenges and exercices I've been doing.
If there is interest in explainations I can write some (contributions are welcome as well :)
